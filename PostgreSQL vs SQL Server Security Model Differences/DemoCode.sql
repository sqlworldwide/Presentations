As you can see, this will become very cumbersome as you will need to grant privileges to each new object to each role based on the operations they need to perform.
In a large application, you will have many roles and many objects (tables, views, etc.), and managing privileges this way can become a nightmare.
We will look at how to manage privileges more efficiently in the Demo II section.
Back to slides for now!!

/*
How do we solve the problem of granting privileges on new objects?
We can use the ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES command to set default privileges for new objects created in a schema.
This way, any new objects created in the schema will automatically have the specified privileges granted to the specified roles.
In order to define default privileges, you need to be the owner of the objects or a superuser.

Ownership of an object in PostgreSQL is determined by the role that created it. 
By default, the creator of an object is its owner.
The following is copied from https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-alterdefaultprivileges.html written by Ryan Booz.

There are three major points you need to understand about object ownership:

Only a superuser or the owner of an object (table, function, procedure, sequence, etc.) can ALTER/DROP the object.
Only a superuser or the owner of an object can ALTER the ownership of that object.
Only the owner of an object can define default privileges for the objects they create.
*/

--who owns the test_table3?
SELECT tablename, tableowner
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename = 'test_table3';

-- See an example why table ownership matters in PostgreSQL
-- We know that devlogin2 is a member of devlogin.
SET ROLE devlogin;
ALTER TABLE test_table3
ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
SET ROLE NONE;

/*
Reasonable solution to solve this problem is to set the ownership of all objects to a role.
That way all members of that role can alter the objects.
Going forward, create all objects with the devgroup as the owner
*/
-- Set the owner of the test_table3 to devgroup
SET ROLE devlogin2;
ALTER TABLE test_table3 OWNER TO devgroup;
SET ROLE NONE;

SET ROLE devlogin;
ALTER TABLE test_table3
ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
SET ROLE NONE;

--Let's change the ownership of the other two tables before we set default privileges

We can repeat the same for other groups like readonlygroup.
But how do we get around this limitation, if we are always creating new databases?
Option 1: Create Roles Once, Grant Privileges Per Database
Option 2: Create a Standardized Setup Script, that you run for each new database
Option 3: Use a Template Database, similar to model in SQL Server
Option 4: Create a function that sets up privileges: call this function in each database
Option 5: Use a Database Extension or Tool that Automates Privilege Management
