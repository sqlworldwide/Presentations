Cardinality estimation (CE) feedback correlation

Correlation:
Fully independent (default for CE70), where cardinality is calculated by multiplying the selectivities of all predicates.
Partially correlated (default for CE120 and higher), where cardinality is calculated using a variation on exponential backoff, ordering the selectivities from most to the least selective predicate.
Fully correlated, where cardinality is calculated by using the minimum selectivities for all predicates.

When the database compatibility is set to 160, and default correlation is used, CE feedback attempts to move the correlation to the correct direction one step at a time based on whether the estimated cardinality was underestimated or overestimated compared to the actual number of rows. Use full correlation if an actual number of rows is greater than the estimated cardinality. Use full independence if an actual number of rows is smaller than the estimated cardinality.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query?view=sql-server-ver16#use_hint
This demo will show CE feedback 'ASSUME_MIN_SELECTIVITY_FOR_FILTER_ESTIMATES'

Causes SQL Server to generate a plan using minimum selectivity when estimating AND predicates for filters to account for full correlation. This hint name is equivalent to Trace Flag 4137 when used with cardinality estimation model of SQL Server 2012 (11.x) and earlier versions, and has similar effect when Trace Flag 9471 is used with cardinality estimation model of SQL Server 2014 (12.x) and later versions.
