Tested on :
SQL Server 2022 CU20
SSMS 21.4.12
	
This code is copied from
https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/features/intelligent-query-processing

Batch mode Memory Grant Feedback
Applies to: SQL Server (Starting with SQL Server 2017 (14.x)), Azure SQL Database with database compatibility level 140
Enterprise only
See https://aka.ms/IQP for more background
Demo scripts: https://aka.ms/IQPDemos 	

Percentile and persistence mode memory grant feedback
Applies to: SQL Server 2022 (16.x) and later
Database compatibility level 140 (introduced in SQL Server 2017) or higher
Enterprise edition only 
Enabled on all Azure SQL Databases by default

Not applicable for memory grant undre 1 MB
Granted memory is more than two times the size of the actual used memory, memory grant feedback will recalculate the memory grant and update the cached plan.
Insufficiently sized memory grant condition that result in a spill to disk for batch mode operators, memory grant feedback will trigger a recalculation of the memory grant.

Query store must be enabled with read_write
