Calculates a percentile based on a continuous distribution of the column value in the SQL Server Database Engine. The result is interpolated, and might not equal any of the specific values in the column.

Computes a specific percentile for sorted values in an entire rowset or within a rowset's distinct partitions in SQL Server.
